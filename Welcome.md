I checked the DRJ Users column flow today. The episodeNumber column is not available in bronze_drj_users, so I traced it back to the Bronze load layer. I found that DRJ Users is loaded through the Lake To Bronze Table Load notebook using the bronze_Control_file_prod.csv config, and the latest landing file does contain the episodeNumber column. So the source file is getting the column, but it is not currently reflected in the Bronze table schema. I’ll continue the next step tomorrow to check the Bronze schema/load handling and confirm the proper fix.

  
  
  

checklist for tommorow

Option 1: ALTER TABLE bronze_drj_users ADD COLUMN episodeNumber STRING

Option 2: Drop/recreate bronze_drj_users from source

Option 3: Enable schema evolution/mergeSchema in Bronze load logic

  
  
  

Yesterday I investigated the missing episodeNumber column for DRJ Users. I checked Silver and Bronze first, then traced it back to the Bronze load process. I found that the latest DRJ Users landing file does contain episodeNumber, but it is not coming through into bronze_drj_users.

  

Today I’ll continue checking the Bronze load/schema handling in the test folder to understand why the new column is not being reflected in the Bronze table. Before making any final change, I’ll confirm the approach with you.

  

will create test table first when you approve we can move to prduction then i can start with attribute
